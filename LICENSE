CFR - License
To be honest, when it comes to licenses for this sort of thing, Jeff Atwood has a good point.

That being said, people ask what license I use, in order that they can conform with adoption policies.

Therefore, CFR uses the MIT license - which essentially says 'do what you want, but don't take credit please'.

If you use/include CFR in something cool, drop me a note!

As mentioned in exhaustive detail elsewhere - Please do NOT use CFR to decompile class files where you do not have legal rights to do so, and please refrain from emailling me anything you don't have a right to.
